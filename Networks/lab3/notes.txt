Aim: Configuration of Switches using Cisco IOS

Earlier connection done with only hub.
Switches are more intelligent.
Hub is a broadcast device, it does not know the destination of the data.
Switches know the destination of the data and send the data to the destination only.

Switches' FastEthernet links are up at the start.
Routers' FastEthernet links are down at the start and need to be configured.

By default, a device is in user execution mode (Denoted by [DEVICENAME]>). This is a non configuration mode. Data and statistics about the device and its configuration can still be viewed.

To get access to privileged commands from user mode, use `enable`.
A device in privileged mode (Denoted by [DEVICENAME]#) has access to more elevated commands.

To get access to configuration mode from privileged mode, use `config terminal`.
A device in global configuration mode (Denoted by [DEVICENAME](config)#) has access to configuration options.

To Do:
	Change Hostname of Device
	Set password via enable secret class to priv mode.
	Save config.
	Config IP Address.


SWITCH OUTPUT:
