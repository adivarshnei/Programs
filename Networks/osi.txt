OSI MODEL
Physical Layer:
	- Actual Physical Connection
	- Information in Bits
	- Hubs/Cables

Data Link Layer:
	- Node to Node Delivery
	- Frames
	- Switches

Network Layer:
	- Host to Host Delivery
	- Packet
	- Routers

Transport Layer:
	- Provide Network Layer Services to Application
	  Layer
	- Segment
	- Firewall

Session Layer:
	- Establish Connections, Maintenance, 
	  Authentication and Security
	- Message
	- Gateway

Presentation Layer:
	- Data From application layer is formatted and 
	  encoded for transmission
	- Message

Application Layer:
	- Helps in identifiying the client and sync 
	  communication.


TCP/IP MODEL (ATIN)
Application Layer:
	- Represents data to user, encoding and dialog 
	  control
	- HTTPS, DNS, DHCP, FTP

Transport Layer:
	- Supports communication between various 
	  devices across diverse networks
	- TCP, UDP

Internet Layer:
	- Determine the best path through the network
	- IPv4, IPv6

Network Access Layer:
	- Control the hardware devices and media that 
	- make up the network
	- Ethernet, WLAN


Comparison
	- Now, both of these models are layered style 
	  models, and they certainly are interoperable.
	In fact:
		------------------------------------------
			OSI				|	TCP/IP
		------------------------------------------
			Application		|
			Presentation	|	Application
			Session			|
		------------------------------------------
			Transport		|	Transport
		------------------------------------------
			Network			|	Internet
		------------------------------------------
			Data Link		|	Network Access
			Physical		|
		------------------------------------------
	
	We can see there is a direct mapping between 
	the two models
