I’m exhausted by daily demands at work, college, and home.
My stress is caused by outside forces beyond my control.
I’m trapped by circumstances that I just have to live with.
No matter how hard I work to stay on top of my schedule, I can’t get caught up.
I have financial obligations I can’t seem to meet.
I dislike my work, but I can’t take the risk of making a career change (or, if not working: I dislike college, but I can’t take the risk of dropping out).
I’m dissatisfied with my personal relationships:
I feel responsible for the happiness of people around me.
I’m embarrassed to ask for help.
I do not know what I want out of life.
I’m disappointed that I have not achieved what I had hoped for.
No matter how much success I have, I feel empty.
If the people around me were more competent, I would feel happier.
People let me down.
I stew in my anger rather than express it.
I become enraged and resentful when I am hurt.
I can’t take criticism.
I’m afraid I’ll lose my job (or fail out of school).
I don’t see the value of expressing sadness or grief.
I don’t trust that things will work out.
