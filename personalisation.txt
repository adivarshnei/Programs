Personalisation

"This misfortune is somehow my fault, I am certain of it"
"I am sorry this is happening to you, I feel completely responsible"

These are examples of Personalisation, a cognitive error which involves us taking situations personally,even if the situation is disconnected or not caused by oneself.
Personalisation can also be seen when someone else is blamed for causing something that they have no relation to or was completely out of their control.
One could also be thinking using peronalisation, when they think they are being excluded from a group upon seeing other members interacting.
Another form of personalisation is the assumption that one is being targeted for someone's behavior.

Stopping Personalisation:
One needs to check their own responsibilities and control towards/of the situation and really ask themselves whether they are responsible or can for how someone thinks/feels or how a situation pans out, and whether the situation is truly out of their control.
