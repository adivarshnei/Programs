1. Write a menu driven program using user defined functions to do the following operations :
a. Generate Fibonacci series where first two numbers and n are taken as parameters .
b. Generate tribonacci series where first three numbers and n are taken as parameters .
2. Write a menu driven program to accept two integers a and b and do the following options. Write UDF for
each option.
- count and return number of all prime numbers between a and b, when a and b are given as
parameters
- count and return number of all even numbers between a and b, when a and b are given as
parameters

3. Write a program using user defined function to calculate sum of the series-
-3!x 2 + 5!x 4 -…………(2n+1)!x 2n . The function should accept x and n as parameters and
return the sum.
4. Write a menu driven program using user defined functions to manipulate a 2-dimensional numeric array
with following choices.
- Add two matrices. The function should take two-dimensional arrays as parameters.
- Print the sum of upper triangular matrix elements . The function should take one two-dimensional array
as parameter.
- Print Transpose of a matrix. The function should take one two-dimensional array as parameter.
5. Write a menu driven program using user defined functions to manipulate a 1-dimensional numeric array
with following choices.
- Find the greatest value from the numbers in the array. The function should take one-dimensional array as
parameter and return the maximum value.
- Sort the elements of the array in ascending order. The function should take one two-dimensional array as
parameter.
- Reverse the array elements. The function should take one one-dimensional array as parameter.
6. Write a menu driven program to using user defined functions to manipulate a 1-dimensional character
array with following choices:
- copy one string to another
- concatenating 2 strings
- check if the string is a palindrome or not
The corresponding functions should take string/strings as parameter.
7. Write program using function overloading to perform the following operations:
- count and return number of words in a string when string is passed as parameter
- count and return number of digits in an integer. The number is passed as parameters
- count number of prime numbers in an integer array and return the count.
