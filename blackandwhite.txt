Black and White
This or That
My Way or the Highway
Zero or One
True or False

- All these words are exact opposite of each other, and can be used as a way to understand the cognitive error, that is black and white thinking.
- Black and white thinking, as it sounds, is the practice of a person to think only in terms of extremes and abolutes.
- It is a very polarized, and frankly narrow minded way of thinking, in which one cannot appreciate the large gap between the extreme scenarios being considered, and it prevents us from seeing how life really is, full of gray areas.
- This is not a good model of thinking, as we are not able to consider the middle ground, and thinking only in extremes is not sustainable in the long run.
- It especially is a hinderance when we need to understand another person's perspective, where a black or white thinking model will not allow one to consider their position, which might be in a gray area.

Situational Example: (Something I relate to unfortunately)
- A student giving an exam might think that if they do not score the maximum marks and score the most plaudits at a certain examination, they have failed.

Solving Black and White thinking:
- Calmly asking another person to clarify their viewpoint can prevent us from jumping to conclusions due to our thinking.
- One can try to think about other outcomes to a situation to prevent a "this or that" way of thinking.
- One can try to think that they are partially right about a situation, rather than completely right or completely wrong.
